# COLMAP-SLAM
[3D Vision](https://www.cvg.ethz.ch/teaching/3dvision/) project supervised by [Paul-Edouard](https://github.com/Skydes)


[COLMAP](https://github.com/colmap/colmap) is a robust framework for Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which reconstructs 3D models from
2D projections i.e. images. The original system was designed for sparse, unordered crowd-sourced images and
is not optimized for continuous video data. This project aims to reframe COLMAP into a more
dynamic offline structure-from-motion (SLAM) system that is simple, fast and robust.

The planned input consists of continuous video feeds.
